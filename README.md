Interactive Graph Coloring GUI
==============================

This project is a Java Swing-based GUI application that visualizes the graph coloring problem using a greedy algorithm. It allows users to dynamically create and color graphs by adding vertices and edges, making it easier to understand and demonstrate chromatic harmony by finding the minimum number of colors required so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Features
--------

-   **Interactive Graph Creation**: Add vertices and edges by clicking on the canvas.
-   **Vertex Movement**: Drag vertices to rearrange the graph layout.
-   **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**: Automatically colors the graph with minimal colors using a greedy approach.
-   **Visual Learning**: Suitable for learning and demonstrating graph coloring concepts.

How to Use
----------

1.  **Set Vertices**: When prompted, enter the number of vertices for the graph.
2.  **Add Edges**: Click on two vertices consecutively to add an edge between them.
3.  **Drag Vertices**: Move vertices around the canvas by dragging them to adjust positions.
4.  **Color the Graph**: Click the "Color Graph" button to apply the greedy coloring algorithm.
5.  **Exit**: Close the application to reset or exit.
